  "body": "# Headless Client\r\n\r\n## The reason, why\r\nThere's not a lot of Headless Clients for Arma2 around and those that are public are neither reliable nor being updated. There's many aspects to face and many things to keep in mind. This Client was created in a way, that makes it independent to players or maps, so basically you can run this on any Map without the need of re- designing the whole Code. Also it doesn't relie on players, so it can be kept active, even after the last player has left your Server. \r\n\r\n## Special Features\r\nThere's loads of things, that you can set and do. You can optimize nearly everything to fit your individual needs. If you want more Zombies inside towns, than in the wilderness, that's totally fine, just check the config file and edit the Settings. If you want to use your own Loot files - no Problem, use your own then. But what, if you want to have 3 times as many Zombies in Wilderness, then in towns? Absolutely no problem! For a full list of features just check the variablesHC.sqf File. \r\n\r\n## Code\r\nNow i am not \"THE\" best programmer in the World and this is also my very first attempt of a Headless Client, but i tried to make the code as clean, optimized and reliable as i could. If you feel like i did something totally wrong or messed up with the code, when it could have been done in a better way, then feel free to issue a Pull Request and let me know about it. Also it happens, that i sometimes forget to take bits and pieces out or put them back in again, as i have quite a few more projects going and i'm unfortionately doing them all at once. \r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nIf you have any need for more Settings to choose from or you think another option would benefit this Project, then please let me know. I wan't to make it as good as i can and for that i need your help! Also you're welcome to post any kind of \"Setting templates\" you might have.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
